### Info

The code here is an updated and improved version of the game based on viewer submissions via pull requests.  The original code from the challenge itself can be found here:

https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/challenges/CC_46_Asteroids

To submit a new issue, [file an issue describing your idea](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Asteroids/issues/new) and [make a pull request](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Asteroids/pulls)! If you make your own version of the game in a separate repo or fork, pull request this README file to add a link.

I'll make a video about how to contribute soon too!

### There... is another.... repository
![oh, luke. stop whining.](http://i.giphy.com/QxHzTRigoD9HG.gif)

**[asteroids-advanced](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/asteroids-advanced)** is setup for the developers who are *overly serious* about code and want the challenge of working in a way that more aptly mimics a team of software developers attempting to make a product. 

Do you think you can handle it? 

If you're still reading this far, I'm willing to bet you're just chomping at the bit to get your grimy hands on our beautiful code. Well, what are you waiting for... Christmas?
